# The residence nil-rate band and inheritance tax - a guide.

In addition to the inheritance tax (IHT) standard nil rate band (currently £325,000.00) a residence nil rate band (RNRB) has been introduced from 6th April 2017. This is available when residential property is left to direct descendants. Initially the RNRB was set at £100.000 but increases by increments of £25,000 each year until it reaches £175,000 in April 2020. Just like the standard nil rate band, any unused RNRB on the first death of a married couple or civil partners has the potential to be transferrable even if the first death occurred before 6th April 2017.

However, the RNRB does come with conditions. The main factors are as follows:-

1. Qualifying Residential Interest
    - The RNRB can only be used by those who held a “qualifying residential interest “at some time during their lifetime. Simply, they need to own or have part ownership of a property that was their residence at some point during the period of ownership;
    - The RNRB cannot be offset against other properties owned by the deceased; for example, buy – to – let or investment properties. However, if the deceased has two qualifying residential interests, then the personal representatives can nominate which property will utilise the RNRB. It cannot be divided across two properties;
    - Any individuals who do not own their home will be unable to utilise the RNRB as they will not have a qualifying residential interest, (although the RNRB may still be available in some cases- for example where the deceased “ downsized” or sold a property to move into residential care on or after 8th July 2015;
    - It will also affect those that have released equity from their property as it is the net value of the home that will be used, so the value of any outstanding loan against the property will have to be deducted from the value to arrive at the net value to be used.
2. Descendants
    - In order to pass on a “qualifying residential interest” and use the RNRB, the property needs to be “closely inherited”. This means that the property must be passed to direct descendants;
    - Direct descendants include children, grandchildren, and any remoter descendants together with their spouses or civil partners, including their widow(er) or surviving civil partner who has not remarried or entered into a new civil partnership. It also includes a step, adopted or fostered child or a child to which the deceased was appointed as a guardian or a special guardian when the child was under 18;
    - Direct descendants do NOT include nephews, nieces, siblings, and other relatives who are not included in the above list;
    - If an individual, a married couple, or civil partners do not have any direct descendants, that qualify, they will be unable to use the RNRB;
    - If a qualifying residential interest is placed into a discretionary will trust, it will NOT qualify for the RNRB, even if the beneficiaries are limited to direct descendants. However, if the Trustees appoint the qualifying residential interest out to direct descendants within two years, the RNRB could potentially be claimed;
    - HOWEVER, if a qualifying residential interest is placed into a bare trust or interest in possession will trust, (amongst others), it will qualify for the RNRB, provided the beneficiaries are direct descendants.
3. Transferring Unused Allowance
    - Like the standard nil rate band, any unused RNRB can be transferred between spouses and civil partners to be used when the survivor of them dies, regardless of when the first death occurred, and whether or not the first deceased held a qualifying residential interest ,( that is, property ownership is not required by the first deceased). The only check that is required is whether the first deceased’s estate was in excess of £2million). The transferrable RNRB must be claimed by the personal representatives within two years from the end of the month in which the second death occurs;
    - Where the first death occurs before 6th April 2017, 100% of the RNRB will be available to be transferred when the surviving spouse or civil partner subsequently dies, unless the estate was “large”. This is the case, regardless of whether or not the first to die owned a qualifying residential interest.
4. Large Estates
    - Where the estate is valued at more than £2million, the RNRB will be progressively reduced by £1for every £2 that the value of the estate exceeds the threshold;
    - In determining whether the £2 million threshold is breached, it is necessary to ignore reliefs and exemptions. This means that business relief and agricultural relief are ignored when determining the value of the estate for the RNRB even though they are taken into account to calculate the liability to IHT;
    - As the £2 million is based on the value of the assets owned at the time of death, it does not include any lifetime gifts made by the deceased, even if they were made within seven years of death and are included in the IHT calculation;
    - The £2 million threshold is frozen until 5th April 2021, after which, like the standard nil rate band, and RNRB, it will increase in line with CPI;
    -When the RNRB is up to £175,000 in the year 2020/21 tax year, estates of £2.35 million or greater will NOT benefit from a RNRB;
    - If the deceased has brought forward an unused RNRB from a spouse or civil partner, then this can also be factored in, so some individuals may not see the RNRB fully disappear until the estate is worth in excess of £2.7 million. The loss of £350,000 means an extra £140,000 of IHT may be payable.
5. Downsizing
    - People can downsize and still benefit from the RNRB;
    - The provisions apply to situations where someone has:-
        - Downsized to a less valuable residence and the new property, together with other assets of an equivalent value to the “lost” RNRB has been left to direct descendants;
        - Sold their only residence, and the sale proceeds (or other assets of equivalent value) have been left to direct descendants;
        - Otherwise ceased to own their own residence and other assets of equivalent value have been left to direct descendants.

    - The qualifying conditions for the RNRB after downsizing are broadly the same as those for the RNRB:
        - Individual died on or after 6th April 2017;
        - The property must have been owned by the individual and it would have qualified for the RNRB had the individual retained it;
        - A lower value property, or other assets, if the property has been disposed of, are in the deceased’s estate;
        - A lower value property, and other assets of equivalent value, are inherited by the individual’s direct descendants on that person’s death.
    - In addition, the following conditions also apply:-
        - The downsizing or the disposal of the property occurs on or after 8th July 2015;
        - As for the RNRB, the value of the property is the net value after deducting any mortgage or other debts charged on the property;
        - The downsizing RNRB would be tapered away in the same way as the RNRB for estates above £2 million;
        - The downsizing RNRB would be applied together with the available RNRB, but the total for the two would still be capped so that they would not exceed the limit of the total available RNRB for a particular year;
        - A claim would have to be made for downsizing RNRB in a similar way that a claim is made to transfer any unused RNRB.
    - If the deceased disposed of more than one home between 8th July 2015 and their date of death, the personal representatives can choose which disposal is taken into account to calculate the downsizing addition. Downsizing would also include disposing of part of a property (including land occupied and used as a garden or grounds) or a share in it.
