- You wish to provide for a surviving spouse who could live in a property for life, receive rental income, or receive income from assets for life;
- Where there is a second marriage scenario; ensure that your second spouse is provided for, but also ensuring that children to the first marriage receive your assets;
- An asset protection against possible future care home fees;
- To keep the family business in the family by holding shares in trust;
- In the case of a business in the family, shares could be held in trust;
- To reduce probate fees and solicitors fees on deathin the light of new legislation which substantially increases the probate fees on death.

- In the case of a property held jointly, the joint tenancy in the property needs to be severed so that you own the property as tenants in common and each own a distinct share, normally one half each.
