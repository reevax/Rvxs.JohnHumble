### Since the introduction of charges for care for the elderly there has been a large amount of irresponsible comment in the media and by vendors of financial schemes and products regarding the avoidance of such charges.

The harsh reality is that the government drafted the National Health Service and Community Act 1990 in the knowledge that attempts to circumvent it would be made - and guarded against them.

First and foremost, the local authority is empowered to disregard, without limit of time, any transaction that they consider as "self-deprivation".

Secondly, any charge that transfers ownership of your home, robs you of your child, is often quoted as being the ideal solution, BUT-

1. Gifting the property, but continuing to live in it, is not a "true gift" in law unless you pay a full market rent.
2. From the date of the gift, it will not be a primary residence of the owner, and will therefore qualify for Capital Gains Tax on any increase in value.
3. If your child becomes involved in bankruptcy, your house will be one of their assets to be claimed in the legal proceedings.
4. If your child dies before you, your house will be part of their estate and go to their beneficiaries.
5. If your relationship with your child breaks down, your ability to remain in your house would be prejudiced.
6. Income Tax on rental value of your house will be payable every year.

Clearly, these factors make gifting a very risky and expensive affair, particularly as only one in six of us actually go into care.

__However there are steps you can take, which are perfectly legal, and severely limit the amount that can be levied upon by the local authority.__

We adjust the ownership of the house to a Tenancy-in-Common, so that husband and wife own one-half each. Then each Will gives the deceased's half of the house to a trust which permits lifetime occupation by the survivor.
