### What is a trust?

A trust is a way of protecting most kind of assets, for example for children under the age of 18. There are various kinds of trusts such as life interest trusts or discretionary trusts, and it is often said that assets are safe in a trust.

### What are trustees?

Trustees are the people who are appointed to look after your property while it is in the Trust. A trust can either be set up during lifetime or in your Will.

### What is the Family Protection Trust?

It is a trust set up during the lifetime of the person setting up the Trust ( “the Settlor” ), and is initially a lifetime trust for the Settlor, and on the Settlor’s death, becomes a discretionary trust, that is a trust that can benefit various classes of people ( known as “beneficiaries”) until it is terminated by the Trustees by distributing the assets. A trust can last as long as 125 years, ans is something completely separate to your Will.

### Why set up an FPT?

- The asset\assets within the FPT are not included within the probate process on death of the Settlor. This can save a lot of time and expense for your executors, as the FPT simply continues through the death of the Settlor;

- From the setting up of the FPT the Trustees take on the responsibility of looking after the asset;

- In the event that the property is placed in the FPT the Settlor can live in the property for life, but the title to the property is placed in the names of the Trustees. If the Settlor wishes to move house, then the Trustees would attend to the paperwork. In the event that the Settlor wanted to sell the house and say move into rented accommodation, then the proceeds of sale would be placed in the FPT and the Settlor would be entitled to the income from the investments for life.

- The asset/s are safe in the FPT as the Settlor no longer owns them, and only has life interest in them;

- On the Settlor’s death the Trustees can make gifts or distributions from the FPT that are based on your wishes, but the Trustees will not make a distribution if, for example, a potential beneficiary is embroiled in a matrimonial dispute, on benefits, or irresponsible with money. During the lifetime of the Settlor, it could protect against the imposition of care home fees.

- The FPT protects against “sideways disinheritance”, that is preventing the Settlor from gifting assets to someone outside of the family, and so cutting out the children.

- It protects against claims after the Settlor’s death by people who may have been cut out of the Settlor’s Will.

### What happens when the Settlor dies?

The Trustees can sell the property, and the proceeds can be distributed by the Trustees to the beneficiaries of the discretionary trust which comes into play when the life intetest trust ends. It is at the discretion of the Trustees as to who receives the proceeds and in what shares. Normally in the Trust Deed there is a very wide class of beneficiaries that can benefit.

### How does the Settlor know after his/her death that the people that he/she wants to benefit, will benefit?

The Trustees will be guided in their discretionary powers in the Trust Deed by a Letter of Wishes prepared by the Settlor during lifetime. It is not binding on the Trustees, but guidance to them, and it is unusual for the Trustees not to abide by those wishes.

### What are the disadvantages of an FPT?

The Trustees become the owners of the asset/s placed in the FPT, and the Settlor only has a life interest in them, which means that if it is a property, that the Settlor can live in the property for life, and if the FPT consists of investments, is entitled to the interest. The Settlor cannot spend the capital, and cannot sell the property and use the capital from it, so that a Settlor must ensure that in putting assets into the FPT that he/she has sufficient other capital and/ or income to live on.

### Does the Settlor need a Will as well?

Yes. Any assets that are not in the FPT need to be dealt with in the Will.
