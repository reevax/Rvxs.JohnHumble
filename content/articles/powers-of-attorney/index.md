*Ensure that your family looks after your property and finance and health and welfare and not the Court of Protection. There are two types of Lasting Powers of Attorney (“LPA”).*

### What is a Lasting Power of Attorney for Property and Finance?

The LPA for Property and Finance replaces the Enduring Power of Attorney.

A Lasting Power of Attorney for property and finance allows the appointment of one or more persons ( with the facility to appoint a replacement attorney or attorneys ) to look after your financial affairs, either to make life easier or in the event that you are no longer capable of looking after your financial affairs. In the event that you become incapable of looking after your financial affairs, and there is no LPA, then an application would have to be made by your closest relative to the Court of Protection. This process is time consuming, expensive and impersonal, both initially, and ongoing in the Court of Protection process.

For the LPA to be used it must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (“OPG”). The cost of registering each LPA is now £82.00 ( reduced on 1st April from £110.00). It is always advisable to register straightaway, in case it is needed, as the registration process takes about 8 weeks. Early registration also means that any possible rejection by the OPG can be dealt with while you are mentally capable of amendment or creating a fresh LPA.

Your attorneys are normally family members, such as spouse or partner.

Your attorneys will have the power, for example, to deal with bank or building society accounts, payment of bills, claiming benefits and to sell your home should the need arise.

The LPA terminates on death, and your Will then takes effect and your executors take over.

### What is a Lasting Power of Attorney for Health and Welfare?

The LPA for Health and Welfare allows your attorney or attorneys to make decisions on your health and welfare, but unlike the LPA for Property and Finance, can only be used when you have become mentally incapable of looking after your own affairs.

This LPA can also allow you to empower your attorneys to make decisions on life sustaining treatment.  The kind of decisions your attorneys could make for you would include, among others, where you live, the type and quality of care you receive and make decisions as to the medicines and treatment you should receive or should not receive.

When you are deciding upon making an LPA, you have the option to restrict how and when it is used.

### What are the main decisions you have to make when deciding upon making an LPA for Property and Finance and Health and Welfare?

- Who is to be your attorney or attorneys? These would normally be close family.

- If you are appointing more than one attorney, do you wish those attorneys to act jointly or jointly and severally? If they act jointly, then both have to sign. Appoint on a joint and several basis, and either can sign. Most of the time people decide on joint and several, as it is administratively easier to sign documents when need be. Also if one attorney of a joint appointment were to die, become mentally incapable or bankrupt, or quite simply give up the appointment, then the whole appointment is lost, and you would then need to rely upon a replacement.

- Do you wish to appoint a replacement attorney or attorneys, in case your primary attorneys can no longer act? This is always advisable.

- You need to decide when your attorney can make decisions, either as soon as the LPA has been registered or only when you no longer have mental capacity.

- You can let people know that you are going to register your LPA. They can raise any concerns they have about the LPA, for example, was any pressure put upon you when making it?

- You can tell your attorneys in the LPA how you would prefer them to make decisions or give them specific instructions which they must follow when making decisions. Most people leave these sections blank.

- You need a certificate provider. I will act as your certificate provider to confirm that I have discussed the LPA with you, and that you understand what you are doing and that nobody is forcing you to do it.

- It is advisable to register the LPA as soon as it is signed.

- In respect of the LPA for Health and Welfare, you need to decide whether you wish to give your attorney or attorneys the power to make decisions on your life sustaining treatment, should that situation ever arise. You can if you so wish, as well as giving your attorney that power, write down the occasions when you would feel it appropriate to make those decisions.
