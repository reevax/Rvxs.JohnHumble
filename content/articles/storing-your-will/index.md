title: 'Storing your will'
summary: 'There is no legal requirement as to where you must register, deposit or store your will. What options have you for keeping your will safe?'
--- 

It used to be the case that when your solicitor or the bank had finalised your Will, that they would automatically retain it in their safe keeping, and let us face it, that meant that it was highly likely that the solicitor or bank would attend to the probate work once the testator died, particularly when the solicitor or bank had been appointed the executor, so there was obviously, and still is, a vested interest at stake in retaining your Will.

Alot of people do not realise that __THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT AS TO WHERE YOU MUST REGISTER, DEPOSIT OR STORE YOUR WILL__. The most important factor is that on your death, your executors must be able to locate it and extract it with as little trouble as possible, and I suppose, with as little time and cost in doing so.

### What options have you for keeping your Will safe?

1. __You can keep your Will in your own home__, as long as you have a fireproof safe securely attached to your property in which to store it. As well as your Will, you could retain any other important paperwork, such as Lasting Powers of Attorney, insurance papers, and paperwork containing details of your digital assets. The advantages of keeping your Will at home are twofold:-
    - If your executors do not know of the location of your Will at the date of your death, it is most likely to be the most obvious and first place they would look;
    - There is no cost, apart from the investment in a safe, which as has been stated previously, could store other important paperwork and details of your personal affairs and is a good long term investment;
    - The disadvantages are that your Will could be accidentally damaged, it could be destroyed by fire, or damaged by damp, mould and spillages;

2. __You could lodge your Will with the Probate Office.__
    - The Probate Registry Office will store your Will in London. This is a government run system whereby on a payment of £20 the Probate Registry will look after your Will. The system provides that you can take your Will to a District Probate Registry such as Newcastle upon Tyne and they will ensure that it is placed in the Central Registry in London. The alternative is to deliver it to the Probate Registry in London yourself. There is a system in place to post your Will to the Principal Probate Registry, but many people are deterred from using the system as it is time consuming to lodge and retrieve the Will;

3. __Store your Will with your solicitor or the bank__
    - This has been the established way to store your Will for many years now, but we must appreciate that substantial changes have come about over the last few years, inter alia:-
        - There are far fewer paper documents to be held with the advancement of technology. Most properties are now registered at the Land Registry, and most other documents are lodged or stored on the web, which means that strong boxes are a thing of the past, and both institutions can invariably not give the same priority and cost towards the storage of Wills. There have been instances of original Wills being stored on the top of filing cabinets, and if a firm says that your Will is stored in its “strongroom”, it often means that, yes it is probably burglar proof, but you need to check whether it is fireproof and floodproof; a lot of the time they are not;
        Solicitors firms more than ever merge or go out of business these days, which means that Wills can be rehoused without the testator being informed, which leads to the worry of tracing the Will and the possibility that it could be lost, and in some cases they are, and it is extremely difficult to prove a copy Will. If you manage to do so it is expensive and time consuming.
        - It is also a well known fact the solicitors and banks have a vested interest in storing your Will, as it is highly likely that on the death of the testator, the executors will instruct the subject solicitor’s firm or bank to attend to the probate work. It should be pointed out that there is no obligation for the executors to use the firm or bank that has stored the Will, and the executors could either attend to the application for probate and the administration of the estate themselves ( which many people do now or with the aid of a professional), or seek appropriate estimates by other probate firms, and in particular, seek a fixed cost estimate for the work that is carried out, otherwise the probate work could attract a percentage fee on the value of the estate a plus an hourly rate charge. __ALWAYS SEEK A FIXED COST ESTIMATE__

4. __Send your Will to a specialist storage firm via your solicitor and register it on a national database.__
    - A further alternative is to send your Will to a specialised outsourced storage business. As a back up to this arrangement your Will should be registered on a national database. The largest of these is known as “Certainty”, a privately operated company (not a government organisation). Charges will be incurred on this arrangement. Normally fees are incurred on lodging and retrieving your Will. It is the writers opinion that this is the safest route to follow.

5. __What about your digital assets? Please refer to separate article.__

### CONCLUSION

There is a wide choice of storage facilities, and it is what suits the testator. There is an advantage to retaining your Will in your own home, as long as you have a good safety deposit box, as with your Will you can retain all your personal information, information that would not be possible to outsource either with your solicitor or outsourced storage business, such as details of your digital assets. You need to consider how your executors will be able to have access to such things as passwords, bank accounts etc.

A time has come for the government to implement a system on Wills whereby every time a will is made it has to be registered on a central register, perhaps something similar to the Land Registry database, where proof of title is guaranteed by the state by way of a computer entry on the Land Register. The current system for the storage and recording of Wills is to a certain extent archaic and ad hoc, and all the systems above, even in conjunction with parallel systems have their shortcomings. Whatever the system that is used, YOUR EXECUTORS MUST BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF YOUR WILL AND IF IT IS UPDATED, AND THEY MUST ALSO BE PRIVY TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF ALL YOUR OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, WHICH AGAIN IS WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE TRUST IN THE EXECUTOR/S YOU APPOINT IN YOUR WILL. YOU SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT IF YOU REVISE YOUR WILL, THAT THE PREVIOUS WILL IS DESTROYED.

When you have completed your Will with your solicitor, it is very important that you are fully aware of where your Will will be stored, and whether that storage facility is safe, and have explained to you all the alternatives available to you. Do not automatically leave it with your solicitor without exploring what is best for you.
